# Home Assistant Aladdin Connect integration

This is the source code of the `aladdin_connect` integration from the Home Assistant 2024.6.4 release,
copied from https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/2024.6.4/homeassistant/components/aladdin_connect

The only change to the source is to the manifest.json, where the codeowners name has been changed and 
a version key has been added, so that a Home Assistant user may use this as a custom integration by copying the `aladdin_connect` package directory into their
Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
